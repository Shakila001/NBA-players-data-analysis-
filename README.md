Task 1: Install Apache Spark and PySpark on your computer.


Task 2: Collect the data of all NBA players since 1980 (i.e. the year of introduction of 3-point-throws).


Task 3: By making use of PySpark:
 * find best scorers sorted in ascending order,

  *analyze the average number of 3 point attempts for each season in a time limit of 48 minutes (an interval corresponding to an approximate full NBA game),
  
  *predict the average number of 3 point attempts for the next 5 years.
